      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mestizo tradition of ayahuasca, known as vegetalismo, emerged as a unique fusion of indigenous Amazonian practices and other cultural influences. This blend reflects the complex history and dynamic cultural exchanges in the Amazon region, particularly during periods of economic upheaval such as the rubber booms of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vegetalismo is characterized by the use of ayahuasca and other plant teachers in healing ceremonies. Unlike the strictly indigenous practices, vegetalismo integrates elements from various cultural and religious backgrounds, including Christianity. Mestizo shamans, or vegetalistas, perform these ceremonies, often incorporating prayers and symbols from Catholicism alongside traditional Amazonian rituals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
