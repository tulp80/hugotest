Ayahuasca, a traditional brew from South America, is known for its powerful hallucinogenic properties and has been used for centuries in spiritual and healing rituals by indigenous tribes. In recent years, its use has spread to North America and Europe, attracting people in their 20s and 30s who travel to countries like Brazil and Peru, particularly Iquitos, to participate in ayahuasca ceremonies.

When consumed, ayahuasca induces hallucinations and spiritual experiences, which are believed to stem from increased introspection. The effects start about 30 minutes after ingestion and can last up to 8 hours. The brew typically contains the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, which has monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A)-inhibiting beta-carbolines, and is often mixed with leaves from the Chacruna or Chagropanga plants, which are rich in the psychedelic compound DMT. Without the MAO-A inhibitor, DMT would be broken down by the body and remain inactive. However, when combined, these ingredients allow DMT to be absorbed and cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to profound psychological and physical effects.

The hallucinogenic experience of ayahuasca is often described as more intense than that of LSD, with users sometimes losing touch with their physical surroundings. Unlike LSD, ayahuasca commonly causes vomiting, which is considered an essential part of the ritual, as it is believed to purge negative energies and toxins from the body.

The popularity of ayahuasca has been bolstered by media coverage and endorsements from celebrities like Sting and Lindsay Lohan. Major media outlets, including The New York Times and Huffington Post, have highlighted its potential benefits, which has contributed to its growing use. Some studies suggest that ayahuasca may help treat psychiatric disorders such as depression and addiction. For instance, a CNN documentary by journalist Lisa Ling showcased the use of ayahuasca among veterans seeking relief from PTSD symptoms. Despite its therapeutic benefits, caution is required. One concern is serotonin syndrome, a condition that can occur when ayahuasca is taken in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Participants should be screened for this medication use and be advised not to partake in drinking ayahuasca when they are taking these medications.
