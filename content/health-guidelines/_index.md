## Medication

For your safety and to ensure the best possible experience during your ayahuasca ceremony, please follow these medication guidelines:

### SSRI Medications

Participants must not be taking any Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) at least six weeks before arrival. SSRIs can interact dangerously with ayahuasca and lead to severe health risks.

### MAOI Medications

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also prohibited. In combination with ayahuasca they can cause life-threatening side effects, including hypertensive crises.

### Antipsychotic Medications

Antipsychotic medications must be discontinued at least six weeks before arrival. These medications can alter the effects of ayahuasca and pose significant risks.

If you are taking any of the above medications, taper off gradually under the supervision of a medical professional. Abruptly stopping medication can lead to withdrawal symptoms and other complications. If you have questions about these guidelines, please contact usâ€”we are here to support you throughout the process.

## Health considerations

While ayahuasca has been used for centuries for spiritual and healing purposes, it may not be suitable for everyone. People with the following conditions cannot participate in ceremonies at AyaSelva:

- Schizophrenia
- Cardiovascular disease
- Epilepsy

## Recreational drugs

Recreational drugs are not allowed at AyaSelva.

## Preparation upon arrival

To ensure a safe and transformative experience, follow these preparation guidelines:

### Dietary restrictions

- **Avoid certain foods.** For at least one week prior to the ceremony, avoid red meat, pork, spicy foods and highly processed foods. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
- **Abstain from alcohol and drugs.** Refrain from consuming alcohol and recreational drugs for at least two weeks before arrival.
- **Limit caffeine intake.** Reduce or eliminate caffeine to help purify your system.

### Sexual activity

Abstain from sexual activity, including masturbation, for at least a week before and after arrival. This helps conserve your body's energy and maintain spiritual focus.

### Mental and emotional preparation

- **Set intentions.** Spend time reflecting on your intentions for attending our retreat center. Meditate, journal, or engage in practices that help you clarify your goals.
- **Emotional stability.** Ensure you are in a stable emotional state before participating. If you are experiencing extreme emotional distress, it may not be the right time for an ayahuasca retreat.
